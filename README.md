Steganography is a bit like hiding a tiny message in something normal. It's like writing a secret note in a book, but the writing looks normal, so nobody suspects there's a hidden message. In the digital world, it's like putting secret stuff in pictures or music without changing how they look or sound. People do this to keep information private or share things without others knowing. It's like having a secret code, but instead of letters, it's hidden in pictures or sounds. Figuring out these hidden messages is important for keeping digital things safe.

# Introduction 
The fundamental principle of steganography lies in exploiting the redundancy or imperceptible alterations within a carrier medium to embed secret data. This carrier medium can be an image with subtle modifications in pixel values, an audio file with imperceptible changes in amplitude, or even a text document with strategically placed 
invisible characters.Steganographic techniques vary in complexity, ranging from simple methods like whitespace manipulation in text documents to advanced algorithms leveraging the least significant bits of image pixels or the frequency components of audio signals. The effectiveness of a steganographic method often relies on its ability to maintain the integrity and perceptual fidelity of the carrier medium while concealing the embedded information.

## Purpose:
This steganography application is designed to offer users a straightforward and visually appealing tool for concealing and revealing messages within image files. Leveraging the art of steganography, it enables seamless embedding and extraction of messages within digital images, ensuring secure communication. The project 
prioritizes user-friendliness, aiming to provide individuals interested in secure communication methods with an accessible platform for hiding messages within images. Overall, the purpose of this steganography application extends beyond mere functionality; it embodies a commitment to fostering privacy, security, and user empowerment in the digital age. By enabling individuals to communicate securely and discreetly through hidden messages within digital images, the application contributes to the advancement of secure communication practices in an increasingly interconnected world.Image Processing and Steganography:The application focuses on a specific set of commonly used image formats, such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP. It integrates a chosen steganographic technique, potentially Least Significant Bit (LSB) embedding, to modify the least significant bits of pixel data and conceal message information. An image capacity analysis mechanism ensures that the message size doesn't exceed the image's capacity, preventing visual distortion of the carrier image. While userfriendliness is paramount, basic password protection can be implemented for embedded messages to enhance security.
