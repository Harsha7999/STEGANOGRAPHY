# STEGANOGRAPHY - The Art of Hiding Data

Steganography is a bit like hiding a tiny message in something normal. It's like writing a secret note in a book, but the writing looks normal, so nobody suspects there's a hidden message. In the digital world, it's like putting secret stuff in pictures or music without changing how they look or sound. People do this to keep information private or share things without others knowing. It's like having a secret code, but instead of letters, it's hidden in pictures or sounds. Figuring out these hidden messages is important for keeping digital things safe.
