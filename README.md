Steganography is a bit like hiding a tiny message in something normal. It's like writing a secret note in a book, but the writing looks normal, so nobody suspects there's a hidden message. In the digital world, it's like putting secret stuff in pictures or music without changing how they look or sound. People do this to keep information private or share things without others knowing. It's like having a secret code, but instead of letters, it's hidden in pictures or sounds. Figuring out these hidden messages is important for keeping digital things safe.

# Introduction 
The fundamental principle of steganography lies in exploiting the redundancy or imperceptible alterations within a carrier medium to embed secret data. This carrier medium can be an image with subtle modifications in pixel values, an audio file with imperceptible changes in amplitude, or even a text document with strategically placed 
invisible characters.Steganographic techniques vary in complexity, ranging from simple methods like whitespace manipulation in text documents to advanced algorithms leveraging the least significant bits of image pixels or the frequency components of audio signals. The effectiveness of a steganographic method often relies on its ability to maintain the integrity and perceptual fidelity of the carrier medium while concealing the embedded information.</br>

# Purpose 
1. **Purpose**: The steganography application offers a user-friendly platform for concealing and revealing messages within digital images, prioritizing accessibility and security in communication.

2. **Steganographic Technique**: Leveraging techniques like Least Significant Bit (LSB) embedding, it modifies the least significant bits of pixel data in image files (JPEG, PNG, BMP) to conceal message information effectively.

3. **Image Capacity Analysis**: The application includes a capacity analysis mechanism to ensure that the size of the hidden message does not exceed the image's capacity, preventing visual distortion of the carrier image.

4. **User-Friendliness**: With a straightforward interface, the application aims to be easy to use for individuals interested in secure communication methods, requiring minimal technical expertise.

5. **Security Features**: Basic password protection can be implemented for embedded messages, enhancing the security of the communication process and safeguarding sensitive information.

6. **Commitment to Privacy and Security**: By enabling discreet communication through hidden messages within images, the application contributes to advancing secure communication practices in today's interconnected digital landscape.

7.**Eample Test Cases:** Embed a secret message within an image, then extract it to verify integrity and undetectability of the concealed data.
